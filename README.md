# Matrix-Operation-Program
My end of semester project in 2024 for my computer algorithms class where we created a Matrix calculator program to display our understanding of C++ classes, data types, and dynamic memory allocation.

How the program works is that a C++ object of the object class "Matrix", as defined in the matrix.h and matrix.cpp files, are created by the user via a user interface in the terminal. 
In the terminal, the user has 10 different options, the first half being how the Matrix-type object is to be created (default constructor, parameterized constructor) and what matrix operations
can be peformed on the Matrix-type objects. The resulting objects are then appended to a dynamic array in the C++ program. Additionally, the matrices used in the matrix operations 


Note:
The program works extremely well,  making me very proud of it, it does have one tiny - but not program-breaking - bug in it. If a user attempts to
